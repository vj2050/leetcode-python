'''
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        citations.sort()
        n = len(citations)
        h = -1
        for i in range(len(citations)):
            if n - i <= citations[i]:
                h = n - i
                return h
        return 0

obj = Solution()
print(obj.hIndex([3,0,6,1,5]))
